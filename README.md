# A multi-functional real-time clock, stopwatch, and countdown timer app

Originally developed in 2020, this Vanilla JavaScript app combines a real-time clock, stopwatch, and countdown timer, offering a simple and efficient solution for tracking time in various scenarios. The app features a live clock display, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer. Built using pure JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, this project demonstrates essential web development skills without relying on modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

Iâ€™ve made several improvements and decided to release it now.

## Features:
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time and updates in real-time.
- **Stopwatch**: Start, stop, lap, and reset functionality for timing events.
- **Countdown Timer**: Set a custom time and count down to zero.
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- User-friendly interface with a clean, minimal design.

## Technologies Used:
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity and functionality.
- **CSS** for custom styling and layout.
- **HTML** for the basic structure.
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design and layout components.
